The source code of an interactive dashboard that allows you to explore the merit order of power plants in Europe. It plots the merit order (supply curve) of the respective power plants. It is using [JRC-PPDB](htps://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/joint-research-centre-power-plant-database-jrc-ppdb) which contains over 7000 individual power plants. You can parametrize the plot by selecting different countries (or combinations thereof), different fuel and carbon price.
